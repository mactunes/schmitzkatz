## YFFZHAB - Young Firefighter of Zons (my hometown) High Altitude Balloon

![YFFZHAB Logo](media/yffzhab.png)

The idea to this project was born when I was watching the first (mainstream?) amateur high altitude balloon (HAB) videos on Youtube some years back. Being one of the guardians of the young firefighters (ages 10 to 17) in my city I asked myself if this could be a nice side project during the winter months where outside training is made tougher due to bad weather, darkness, etc.

If all goes well, we will launch 2 balloons on different days. The first starting in early March, 2015 and the second one most likely a month later. The first balloon will carry a Raspberry Pi taking videos and cheap GPS and GSM trackers bought of eBay.

If the first balloon launch goes well, we will extend on this design and use a Pi NoIR camera with a blue filter in order to check out plant growth and add some temperature sensors.

During the next weeks I will be writing more about our findings on the 2nd balloon design. Here is what you can expect to read:

1. Recording videos with the Raspberry Pi - The Raspberry Pi is an awesome piece of hardware! And it is extremely suitable for HAB missions. We will show the software we wrote to (hopefully) capture videos.
2. Powering electronics in extreme temperatures - It's tougher than we thought! When building our first prototype we did a freezer test. The payload which consisted of a smartphone enclosed in a styrofoam box died within 20 minutes, because the batteries couldn't sustain their voltage in these conditions.
3. Insulation - What does it take to keep the electronics warm (enough) at -40 to -60 centigrades?
4. Tracking the balloon - It's easy to launch a balloon, but how do you find it when it travels 150km?
5. Miscellaneous - I will go through some other often forgotten topics that are relevant on launching a balloon. Which parachutes to use, regulations here in Germany, etc.
6. The launch - hopefully we will be able to present a video! Keep your fingers crossed!
