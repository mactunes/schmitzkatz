            Launching a high altitude balloon is not cheap and can't be done for 100 dollars (as some people claim) unless you already own most material before building the payload. This short article shows all the materials needed to build and launch a HAB.

            In the last post I wrote about how to record videos in suboptimal environments. In this post I will focus on an even tougher thing: powering electronics where normal batteries will fail.

            Last week I summed up what (I think) is needed to build a high altitude balloon. This week I will explain how we built a camera using a Raspberry Pi taking high-definition videos at 20km altitude and at -40 to -60 degrees centigrade.

            A couple of months ago I decided to launch a high altitude balloon into the stratosphere with a group of young volunteer firefighters.

            After starting my Java app I got a message that the serial port I was trying to connect to was already in use. The problem turned out to be a completely different thing.

            The Raspberry Pi is an awesome piece of hardware for little money. Connecting a RS-232 to USB adapter the Pi often leads to the system freezing, though. Here is a simple way to fix it.

            When the iPhone came out it wasn't only its awesome browser that made it perfect for browsing the web on the go. Apple also added a lot of neat stuff to iOS and webkit to make webapps look cooler. Apparently Apple broke one of them with the iPhone 5.

            Growing up next to a lake I have always been fascinated by the underwater world. A recent article in the Daily Mail about a man creating his own ecosphere in a sealed bottle got me interested in building my own.

            Many blog-engines have been written. Most dynamic ones require quite some setup. On the other hand the static engines I have tested usually require for a specific version of Ruby. This is why I wrote my own blog-engine.
