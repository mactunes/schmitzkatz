                My name is Rudy and I was born and currently live in Dormagen, Germany. When I was 13 my family and I moved to Timmins, Ontario 
                in Canada which I am happy about. It's definitely one of the most beautiful countries in the world! After a 2 year stay we returned to Germany.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Canada I got my first Computer which was a Macintosh Performa 5200 CD. This machine got me hooked and I spent 
                days and nights in front of it. It got me into what I do for a living today: software engineering.
            </p>

                After studying software engineering for 4 years until 2007 I got particularly interested in mobile devices. 
                I started off with developing for the J2ME platform. When Apple released the iPhone it changed everything.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today I develop for the most important desktop and mobile operating systems including Mac OS, 
                Windows UWP, iOS, Android and Apple TV.
            </p>

                More recently I am starting to enjoy the maker scene and the internet of things topic more and more. 
                Together with a group of kids I've launched 6 high altitude balloons which started my interest in electronics. 
                I am currently in the process of designing my own circuit for a LoRa-based IS-gateway.
